Right, so just a quick recap as to where we are and so well done, you've got very, very far. We're almost there. We are doing our strategy here. We've got the tradable symbols, we've got their price history, we've worked out the code integration. We've ranked all of the code integrated pairs based on how often they cross the zero mark. And now we have a table we can analyze. But we need to actually build the mechanism for, you know, getting some charts and analyzing that data. So the idea here is we will input, you know, some kind of PR. We will pick it from the spreadsheet, put it in that will analyze it for us, shows the chart and save a spreadsheet for that pair based on, you know, all all of the prices, the spreads, et cetera, so that we can also put it in a backtesting model that are built for you in Excel. So there's still loads of stuff to do, but it's all going to move quite quickly from here. We've got one more kind of more lengthy video around or lengthy tutorial, I should say, around actually just building the code, but we're already reusing a lot of the code we built. So it's just a sequence. We'll get it done. You know, we'll kind of smash it in one go and then we will. In the subsequent video actually look at the charts and I think you're going to be really excited by that. And then we'll get to the Excel Back test. We're going to spend some good time on that because it's very important to talk about backtesting and, you know, all the results reliable or not. And where are they not reliable? And how are we going to prove that this is indeed a good strategy? So we got some more things to do, but let's jump into the next video and crack on. Stay with me. You're doing super well.
