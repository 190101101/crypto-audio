So for those of you who are wondering, how do you place a short position versus how do you place a long position? Well, the good news is it's very straightforward, as you might have guessed you, just click on the short position area here. So if I, for example, place a market order just because that'll be quicker and again, just as good practice, I'm going to add in a stop loss of some kind. I'm going to open a short position here and click Confirm. And there you go. I'm now in an open position. It's a short position. You can see it down here. Quantity is negative five, which indicates it's a it's a short and it's highlighted in red here. I mean, this area is highlighted in red because right now it's it's in a loss, which is it seems to be the luck we're having today. Oh, we went green for a second, but so we're in the loss here right now. Now we're in profit, but you know, it doesn't really matter. It's not the point of this video. It's very straightforward to place a short position. It's exactly the same as the long. And the stop loss is actually, you know, above where the price was of the short position. So the stop loss will be, you know, above if you're placing a long position in, the stop loss will be below and vice versa for the take profit. So pretty straightforward stuff. And if you were interested in shorting in general and the dangers around that, just watch the optional video that was posted before this one. I'm going to go ahead and close this at a profit. Not because it really matters, but just because I feel good closing in the green and we'll move on to the next video.
